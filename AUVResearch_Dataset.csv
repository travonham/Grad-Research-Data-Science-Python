"*Of course more data is always better, but I think I identified the most important time frames",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
*Could be useful to characterize the hypoxic zone of the central basin of Lake Erie,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*I primarily work in inland waters that are in Great Lakes Basins, so I tailored my responses to that backdrop.  You as the researchers can determine whether they are useful or not, given that I don't usually work in the Great Lakes themselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*Temp and chlorophyll highest priority but other listed WQ parameters are important as well.  I‰Ûªm not a water quality person but I would rank pH low At leastbatbthe offshore / whole lake scale. I assume the AUV swarms would fly up and down through the water column to provide vertical profiles of all parameters. In terms of frequency, as often as possible (so depending on the spatial extent the AUV was programmed for daily would be great, but anything is better than nothing!",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*I do not consider myself a fisheries worker, but a physical scientist dealing with the Great Lakes. My highest interest is measurements of temperature at all depths in the lakes.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It would seem stand along sensors (HOBO, YSI) would be a more appropriate and higher resolution option for collecting basic data.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*Water data is often able to be collected at relatively short intervals - with new sensors and technology - so should be collected at the shortest time interval as feasible with gear - In my opinion. I checked almost all boxes for ""how often"" based on this opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
" temporal changes in those parameters are rare, often only grab samples for short times of year, high res data, at long time intervals would be most useful to the most people",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
*Collection of organisms or video work would be of particular interest to us.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Depending on how you plan to use an AUV swarm, temperature could be important.  We already have good surface temperature data from NOAA, so value added would be temperatures at depth once warming begins and before fall turnover.  More thought needs to be put into this aspect of your proposal.I submit that DO is an issue after June, rather than form April through October.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*I'm very new to fisheries management, so please weigh my responses accordingly.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*I am not sure how useful my or other answers will be to such a general question.  Yes all the variables can be important and can be important in all the specified habitats.  This does not really lead to priorities.  E.g., if you want to understand what might be inhibiting lake trout production you might focus on spawning habitat and year round.  If similarly for black bass then maybe only April -October.  Most of the variable will show substantial seasonal variation at time scale of less than a month and for some purposes you might want variables like temperature daily.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*Benthic invertebrate communities diversity and abundance, particularly in regard to benthic habitat type, quantity and quality ( ie degraded, pristine etc).",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*Frequency of data collection depends on the questions being asked.  E.g., depth surveys could be done once per year, but DO surveys may be done hourly for 24 hrs once a month.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
*Timing of collection depends on season- I don't think weekly collections are necessary in the winter - but during bloom season they are needed- monthly in the winter is reasonable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*DO profiles are useful but measurements at the sediment water interface is very important and just immediately above the sediment water interface (like maybe 18 inches up. This needs measuring over a variety of substrates, silt, sand, rock. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*Any of these potential basic measurements could be useful, but I'm not certain that the scale  of a swarm of AOV's would provide data useful to me.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,

Also within habitats characterization, in a general way in guess I figured there would be some recording of basic features (likely with video).
